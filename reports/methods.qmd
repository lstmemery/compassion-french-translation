## Analyses

All statistical analyses were performed on R 4.2.1. Code can be found
here: https://github.com/lstmemery/compassion-french-translation

## Confirmatory Factor Analyses

All CFAs were fit with lavaan version 0.6-12[@lavaan]. semTools
0.5-6[@semTools] was used to visualize path diagrams. Before fitting any
model, each scale's polychoric correlation matrix was examined using
[@psychci]. Unless otherwise noted, all models were fit with the robust
maximum likelihood estimator. All models also had standardized latent
variables. Responses that were complete for a scale were included. The
models reflect the structures of the scales where they were first
published. In addition, if a model failed to converge or had poor
goodness of fit, alternative models were fit.

**SOCS-S:**

## Internal Consistency

Internal consistency of total scale and sub-scale items was assessed
using both Cronbach's alpha and omega coefficients. Omega and alpha
coefficients were computed using the compRelSEM function in semTools on
the model that reflects the model with the most parameters in the
previously published paper.

# Results

All scales examined had positive semi-definite polychoric matrices.
